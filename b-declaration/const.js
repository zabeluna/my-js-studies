/*
* You cannot create constants with reserved words.
* It's recommended to use meaningful names as it helps with readability.
* They cannot start with numbers, nor contain spaces or hyphens.
* Use camelCase, and remember they are case-sensitive.
* The value of constants cannot be modified.
* Use `const`, not `var` (with `var` you can declare and redeclare easily, but it may cause readability issues in the code editor).

// In other words, I donâ€™t need to use let multiple times. I only declare it once and can replace it using the variable name.
